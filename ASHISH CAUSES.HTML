<P>
	There are a number of reasons that can contribute directly or indirectly to the extinction of a species or group of species.
 	The primary causes of species extinction or endangerment are habitat destruction, commercial exploitation
 	(such as plant collecting, hunting, and trade in animal parts), damage caused by non-native plants and animals
	 introduced into an area, and pollution. <BR>
	The survival of ecosystems (plant and animal communities and their physical surroundings) such as forests,
	 coral reefs, or wetlands depends on their biodiversity, or variety of plants, animals, and habitats,
	 as well as the many interactions among these species. The removal or disappearance of one or several species
	 may irreversibly damage the ecosystem and lead to its decline.
