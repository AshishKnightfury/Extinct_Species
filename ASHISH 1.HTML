	Ancestors of the present day elephants, woolly mammoths are included in the list of extinct species that used to exist in the cold,
	 snowy areas of North America. Their extinction began back in 10, 000 BC and their species completely disappeared by 8,000 BC.
	 The main cause was contributed by the natural factors. When the ice age came to an end,
	 their natural habitat was lost and they no longer had the chilly cold environment suitable to their survival.<BR>
	 Moreover, the vegetation which these animals used to feed on also disappeared because of the change in climate,
	 leading to the inevitable death of these creatures. The prehistoric man also contributed a little to their extinction by overhunting. 
	These facts about the woolly mammoth would fascinate you:<BR>

•	Woolly mammoths were huge creatures with a height of 15 feet and around 8 tons of weight.<BR>
	 Today's elephants have almost the same size. <BR>
•	Their beautiful tusks reached the length of five meters which were probably used for clearing away the thick snow to find food underneath.<BR> 
•	Unlike the elephants of the modern world, woolly mammoths had a thick fur coat as an adaptation for their survival in the cold Arctic Tundra. <BR>
•	Due to the cold environment, their fossils are better preserved than any other organism, being found in organic state instead of stone state.<BR>
