	Saber-toothed cat, also called the saber-toothed tiger, Smilodon or, at times, simply saber-tooth,
	 is a member of the now-extinct machairodontinae genus of carnivorous mammals.
	 (Even though it is often referred to as saber-toothed tiger, it is not a species of tiger.)
	 It was native to North America and South America, and lived during the Pleistocene era. 
	Its habitat consisted of wooded grasslands, shrub lands and Savannah.
