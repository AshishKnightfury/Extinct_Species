	This awe-inspiring creature is another of the unfortunate organisms which disappeared quite recently,
	 mainly due to its biggest predator man. Also known as the Persian Tiger, it used to exist in the forests of Iran,
	 Turkey, Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, Iraq, Uzbekistan, Mongolia and Turkmenistan.<BR><BR>
	A land reclamation project was undertaken when the twentieth century began,
	 clearing away the land which was house to the Caspian tiger.
	 A large number of the animal members was also killed as a part of the reclamation project. On the other hand,
	 a loss of habitat resulted in the disappearance of the rest.<BR>
