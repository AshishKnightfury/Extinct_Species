	Extinction is a process through which a group of certain organisms completely disappears from the face of earth. 
	This happens when the rate of death of the members of a species becomes greater than the rate of their birth.
 	Ultimately, when the last few organisms belonging to that species die, they are referred to as extinct species from then onwards.

	Extinction is a normal process in the course of evolution.
 	Species have slowly evolved and disappeared throughout geologic time as the result of climate changes and the inability to adapt to survive competition and predation.
 	Since the 1600s, however, the rate of extinction has accelerated rapidly because of human population growth and human resource consumption.
 	Today, most of the world's habitats are changing faster than most species can adapt to through evolution, or natural selection.
 	The current global extinction rate is exponentially greater than the background extinction rate.
 	Many biologists believe that we are in the middle of the greatest mass extinction episode since the disappearance of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago.
	Dinosaurs, mammoths, and quagga are a few of the most popular extinct animals which used to exist on the planet Earth a very long time ago.
	 Some organisms also went through extinction quite recently while some precious members of the Kingdom Animalia today are facing the risk of this horrible fate.
	 The reasons include both the natural causes and human activities.
