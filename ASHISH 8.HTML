	A quagga one of the most fascinating organisms indeed was a half-zebra and half-horse.
	Belonging to a subspecies of the plain zebra, a quagga possessed the same stripped appearance at the
	front part of its body. However, these stripes faded away towards the organism's mid-section,
	leading to a completely plain rear. Moreover, unlike the black and white plain zebra,
	quagga was brown in color with dark brown stripes.<BR> 
	The animal went through extinction quite recently in the 1880s. The main reason was overhunting
	of this beautiful creature for its valuable hide as well as meat.<BR>
	Here is what you should know about this unique creature : <BR>
•	Quagga belonged to the Cape Province as well as the southern region of Orange
	 Free State of South Africa.<BR> 
•	It was a herbivorous organism and used to feed on grass which was also food
	 for the domestic cattle.
	The local farmers, therefore, considered it a pest and used to hunt the
	 unfortunate creature extensively.<BR> 
•	The last of the wild quaggas was killed by man in 1870s while the last of them remaining in captivity died in
	 1883.<BR>
