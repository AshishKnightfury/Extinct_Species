	(Hydrodamalis gigas), also called Steller’s sea cow, very large aquatic mammal, now extinct,
	 that once inhabited nearshore areas of the Komandor Islands in the Bering Sea.<BR>
	 Steller’s sea cows were wiped out by hunters in the 18th century less than 30 years after they were
	 first discovered by Arctic explorers.<BR>
	 Today, the term sea cow is sometimes used to refer to other sirenians,
	 namely, the manatee and the dugong.
