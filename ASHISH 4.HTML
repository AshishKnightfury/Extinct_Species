	The Carolina Parakeet is classified as Extinct (EX), there is no reasonable doubt that the last individual has died.
	The Carolina Parakeet (Conuropsis carolinensis) was the only parrot species native to the eastern United States.
 	It was found from the Ohio Valley to the Gulf of Mexico, and lived in old forests along rivers.
	 It was the only species at the time classified in the genus Conuropsis.
	 It was called puzzi la née ("head of yellow") or pot pot chee by the Seminole and kelinky in Chikasha 
	(Snyder & Russell, 2002). <BR>
	The Carolina parakeet was the northernmost representative of the parrot family. 
	It had green plumage with a yellow head and orange cheek patches and forehead.
	The largest specimens were 13 in. (33 cm) in length, including the tail feathers.
	 It was formerly distributed throughout the SE United States, as far north as Virginia and as far west as Texas;
	 the last specimens were seen in S Florida early in the 20th cent.
